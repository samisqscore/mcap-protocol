# MCAP: A Research Hypothesis for AI-Driven Legacy Modernization

## Abstract üß†
Legacy COBOL systems, critical to enterprise operations, face modernization challenges due to undocumented business logic, retiring developers, and high costs. This paper proposes the Mainframe Context Aware Protocol (MCAP), a hypothetical framework extending Anthropic‚Äôs Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Google‚Äôs Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol to enable secure, context-aware COBOL-to-Java modernization. MCAP orchestrates multi-agent workflows, preserves business logic, and ensures compliance. Through a conceptual architecture, design principles, and a claims processing use case, we explore MCAP‚Äôs potential. Research questions and a development roadmap are outlined, inviting collaboration to validate this approach.

## 1. Introduction üöÄ
Legacy COBOL systems power critical enterprise functions, processing $3 trillion in daily transactions and 95% of ATM operations ([IBM Research, 2023](https://research.ibm.com)). However, a shrinking developer pool, undocumented logic, and $1.52 trillion in U.S. technical debt ([RTInsights, 2023](https://www.rtinsights.com)) hinder modernization. Traditional methods struggle to preserve institutional knowledge, leading to high failure rates ([Ars Technica, 2023](https://arstechnica.com)).

Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, with tools like IBM‚Äôs watsonx Code Assistant ([CROZ, 2024](https://croz.net)) and CloudFrame‚Äôs CodeNavigator ([CloudFrame, 2024](https://cloudframe.com)) achieving functional equivalence in COBOL-to-Java conversion. Yet, LLMs lack secure access to mainframe context, risking logic corruption. This paper proposes the Mainframe Context Aware Protocol (MCAP), extending Anthropic‚Äôs MCP ([Anthropic, 2024](https://www.anthropic.com)) and Google‚Äôs A2A protocol ([Google Cloud, 2025](https://cloud.google.com)), to enable AI-driven modernization.

## 2. The Legacy Modernization Challenge üéØ
COBOL systems face:
- **Developer Shortage**: Retiring experts create a skills gap ([Built In, 2023](https://builtin.com)).
- **Undocumented Logic**: Business rules reside solely in code.
- **System Complexity**: Decades-old interdependencies increase risks.
- **High Costs**: Maintenance drains IT budgets.

LLMs require a protocol to access mainframe context securely, preserving logic and ensuring compliance.

## 3. Protocol Foundations üî¨
### 3.1 Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP, an open standard by Anthropic, uses JSON-RPC 2.0 to connect AI agents to tools and data ([Anthropic, 2024](https://www.anthropic.com)). It offers:
- **Resource Access**: Exposes files and databases.
- **Tool Integration**: Enables function execution.
- **Context Management**: Maintains state.
Google‚Äôs integrations with Cloud SQL and Spanner validate MCP‚Äôs adoption ([Google Cloud, 2025](https://cloud.google.com)). MCP could enable secure mainframe access for modernization.

### 3.2 Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol
A2A, an open-source protocol announced by Google at Cloud Next 2025, enables AI agents from different vendors and frameworks to collaborate ([Google Developers, 2025](https://developers.googleblog.com)). Backed by over 50 partners (e.g., Salesforce, SAP), A2A uses HTTP and JSON-based ‚ÄúAgent Cards‚Äù for:
- **Capability Discovery**: Agents advertise skills.
- **Task Management**: Coordinates complex workflows.
A2A complements MCP, enabling multi-agent modernization pipelines.

## 4. MCAP: A Hypothetical Framework üèóÔ∏è
MCAP extends MCP and A2A for mainframe modernization, orchestrating secure, context-aware AI workflows.

### 4.1 Architecture Components
1. **Secure Legacy Interface**:
   - Read-only access to sanitized COBOL extracts.
   - Compliance with GDPR and PCI-DSS via data redaction.
   - Versioned snapshots for consistent analysis.
2. **Context Preservation Engine**:
   - Maps semantic relationships in COBOL programs.
   - Identifies business rule clusters.
   - Captures knowledge from code patterns.
3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**:
   - Analysis Agent: Extracts code structures.
   - Domain Agent: Interprets business logic.
   - Security Agent: Ensures compliance.
   - Generation Agent: Produces Java code.
   - Review Agent: Coordinates human validation.
4. **Human-AI Collaboration Interface**:
   - SME validation workflows.
   - Visualizations of AI interpretations.
   - Audit trails for compliance.

### 4.2 Design Principles
| Principle | Implementation Hypothesis | Benefit |
|-----------|--------------------------|---------|
| Context Fidelity | Maintain semantic relationships | Preserve business logic |
| Incremental Safety | Modular transformation with checkpoints | Reduce risk |
| Collaborative Intelligence | Human-AI validation | Combine AI efficiency with expertise |
| Protocol Extensibility | Built on MCP/A2A standards | Leverage existing infrastructure |
| Audit Transparency | Traceability from source to output | Meet compliance needs |

## 5. Conceptual Application: Claims Processing üìä
Consider an insurance company‚Äôs COBOL-based claims system.

### 5.1 Workflow
1. **Context Discovery**:
   - MCP agents access COBOL code and schemas.
   - Context engine maps dependencies.
   - Example COBOL snippet:
     ```cobol
     IF CLAIM-TYPE = 'AUTO' AND DAMAGE-AMOUNT > 25000
        IF POLICY-YEARS < 3
           PERFORM HIGH-RISK-REVIEW
        ELSE
           IF CUSTOMER-CLAIMS-COUNT > 2
              PERFORM FRAUD-CHECK
           END-IF
        END-IF
     END-IF
     ```
   - LLM Output: ‚ÄúRisk assessment for auto claims over $25,000 based on policy tenure and claim history.‚Äù
2. **Multi-Agent Analysis**:
   - Analysis Agent: Extracts control flows.
   - Domain Agent: Interprets rules using MCP-provided schemas (e.g., `CLAIM-TYPE: STRING`).
   - Security Agent: Flags compliance issues.
3. **Human Validation**:
   - SMEs review AI interpretations via visualizations.
   - Approval workflows capture feedback.
4. **Modernization**:
   - Generation Agent produces Java:
     ```java
     @Component
     public class ClaimRiskAssessment {
         public ReviewDecision assessAutoClaimRisk(Claim claim, Policy policy, Customer customer) {
             if (claim.getType() == ClaimType.AUTO && claim.getDamageAmount() > 25000) {
                 if (policy.getYearsActive() < 3) {
                     return ReviewDecision.HIGH_RISK_REVIEW;
                 } else if (customer.getClaimCount() > 2) {
                     return ReviewDecision.FRAUD_CHECK;
                 }
             }
             return ReviewDecision.STANDARD_PROCESSING;
         }
     }
     ```
   - Review Agent validates equivalence.
5. **A2A Collaboration**:
   - A2A delegates optimization to a specialized agent:
     ```json
     {
       "AgentCard": {
         "id": "CodeOptimizerAgent",
         "capabilities": ["java_optimization"],
         "task_types": ["optimize_code"],
         "endpoint": "https://optimizer-agent.example.com/api"
       }
     }
     ```

### 5.2 Hypothetical Benefits
- Preserved logic with audit trails.
- Reduced human effort via automation.
- Incremental, low-risk transformation.
