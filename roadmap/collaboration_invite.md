# 🤝 Invitation to Collaborate on MCAP

We believe legacy modernization doesn’t need to be slow, risky, or opaque. With the right combination of AI, protocols, and human insight, it's possible to preserve decades of business knowledge and deliver maintainable modern systems.

## 📣 What We're Building

**MCAP (Mainframe Context Aware Protocol)** is a proposed open architecture that:

- Uses LLMs to extract and transform legacy COBOL logic
- Maintains semantic context across large codebases
- Enables multi-agent workflows with MCP + A2A integration
- Embeds SME validation, compliance, and traceability

This project is in the research + early prototyping phase and needs diverse expertise to move forward.

## 🧬 Let’s Redefine Legacy Modernization

> COBOL may be 60 years old, but the business logic it holds still runs the world.  
Let’s ensure we can modernize it without losing the knowledge inside.

Join us. Collaborate. Improve. Co-create.

🌍 From legacy to future—together.
