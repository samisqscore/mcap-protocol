# 🗺️ MCAP Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the proposed development and validation phases for MCAP (Mainframe Context Aware Protocol) from hypothesis to practical implementation.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Now – Q3 2025)

- [x] Draft MCAP research hypothesis
- [x] Publish research article on LinkedIn
- [x] Set up GitHub repository and documentation
- [x] Define agent roles and architecture diagram

---

## 🧪 Phase 2: Proof of Concept (Q3–Q4 2025)

- [ ] Identify COBOL sample programs for pilot (e.g. Claims Processing)
- [ ] Build mock MCP/A2A agent orchestrator
- [ ] Simulate agent flow with prompt-driven LLMs (Claude, GPT)
- [ ] Log context traces and transformation paths
- [ ] Evaluate traceability and accuracy of generated code

---

## 🔐 Phase 3: Compliance & SME Workflow (Q4 2025 – Q1 2026)

- [ ] Define sanitization profiles and compliance sandbox
- [ ] Implement SME feedback interface (manual or UI)
- [ ] Validate business rule preservation with real domain SMEs
- [ ] Test audit trail generation for regulators

---

## 🧠 Phase 4: Multi-Agent Interoperability (2026)

- [ ] Implement A2A-compatible agents (CodeGen, Optimizer, Validator)
- [ ] Test task delegation between agents
- [ ] Publish JSON-based AgentCard definitions
- [ ] Integrate with external tools (e.g. GitHub Copilot, Open Policy Agent)

---

## 🚀 Phase 5: Community & Open Specification

- [ ] Release MCAP protocol spec (v0.1) as open standard
- [ ] Create documentation portal using GitHub Pages or Notion
- [ ] Invite contributions from modernization teams and AI researchers
- [ ] Host webinar/demo to showcase results and share learnings
